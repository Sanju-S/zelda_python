# Zelda Python Game

## What is it?
It is a basic Zelda style game written completely using Python (PyGame)

## How to run it?
* Clone the repo or download the zip to your local device.
* Install the requirements using **pip**.
* Run the *main.py* file in the `code` directory.

Or just follow the below steps: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanju-S/zelda_python.git
cd zelda_python
pip install requirements.txt
python code/main.py 
```

## Is it the best game out there in the wild?
If you ask me then no, but in reality? still no.
This game is in no way meant to compete against all the triple A titles around the globe. (*and frankly I love my sanity way too much to do it*) It is a simple piece of code to learn how to use pygame.

## Will I enjoy playing the game?
If you like Zelda style games then possibly yes but if you think I value my time more than this then I think there is a slight chane that may not *like* it.

## Can I expect an update in future?
No
