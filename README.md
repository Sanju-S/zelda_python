# Zelda Python Game

## What is it?
It is a basic Zelda style game written completely using Python (PyGame)

## How to run it?
* Clone the repo or download the zip to your local device.
* Install the requirements using **pip**.
* Run the *main.py* file in the `code` directory.

Or just follow the below steps: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanju-S/zelda_python.git
cd zelda_python
pip install requirements.txt
python code/main.py 
```

## What can I do in the game?
Just like in real life, you have to survive in the map against various enemies who will try to kill you, unless you kill them all first. You have 4 different type of weapons doing various damage to the enemy and have various stats. You also have the ability to use magic spells which will have different effect on enemies and yourself as well. You earn *exp* for killing enemies and use these fake points to upgrade your various stats including - 
* health
* energy
* attack
* magic
* speed

## What are the controls?
* Press `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move around. (or use arrow keys)
* Press `SPACE` to attack using your chosen weapon.
* Press `Q` to toggle between various weapons. (currently 4)
* Press `V` to use your magic.
* Press `E` to toggle between various magics. (currently 2)
* Press `M` to toggle Menu. (and pause the game \**of course*\*)
  * Move around the menu with `LEFT` and `RIGHT` arrow keys.
  * Press `SPACE` to upgrade the selected stat. (It will cost you experience and can be seen on the screen)

## Is it the best game out there in the wild?
If you ask me then no, but in reality? still no.
This game is in no way meant to compete against all the triple A titles around the globe. (*and frankly I love my sanity way too much to do it*) It is a simple piece of code to learn how to use pygame.

## Will I enjoy playing the game?
If you like Zelda style games then possibly yes but if you think you value your time more than this then I think there is a slight chance that you may not *like* it.

## Can I expect an update in future?
No
